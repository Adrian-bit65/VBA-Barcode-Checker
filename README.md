# VBA-Barcode-Checker
VBA code for checking if two values are the same from two pasted lists with the second list having questionable formatting.

For the desired batch:
One would need to paste in the list from the Hamilton "Sample Dilution" file
Then paste in the snapshot for that specific batch (drag-clicking from just in front of the "1" to the bottom of the list at "COVID.DL")
Then go to Developer > Macros > BarcodeListAndCheck
